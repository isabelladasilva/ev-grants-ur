    <p class="govuk-body">We have sent you and Electric City Installers an email to confirm you have submitted your application.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Use your reference number to search the applications on your dashboard.</p>


    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens now</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      The properties you have listed are covered by the grant.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      You can now contact your installer to get the chargepoints installed.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Check that the chargepoints used are on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/electric-vehicle-homecharge-scheme-approved-chargepoint-model-list">OZEV authorised installer list (opens in a new tab)</a> . Only OZEV approved chargepoint models will receive the grant.
    </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">How long is my application valid</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Your application is valid for 90 days. The grant amount is secure until [day month year].
    </p>

    <div class="govuk-inset-text">
    This means your installer has 90 days to install the chargepoints and submit the claim by [day month year].
    </div>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens after the installation</h2>
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Your installer will submit the grant claim</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">
    When your installer finishes the work, they will submit evidence of the installation. This includes:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>photos of the chargepoints in the parking space</li>
      <li>photos of the chargepoints</li>
      <li>a copy of your customer invoice</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">
We will pay the grant to your installer. You must get the total grant amount passed on to you as a discount.
    </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Review and confirm your installation</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Once your installer submits the claim we will send you an email to review the application.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      You will have 7 working days to confirm the application. If you do not take any action we will accept the claim and process the payment.
    </p>
