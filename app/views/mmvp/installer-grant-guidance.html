<h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="overview">Which grants can landlords get?</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">There are 2 grants to support residential landlords with the cost of installing EV chargepoints:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>the Chargepoint grant for landlords pays towards the cost of buying and installing chargepoints for landlords’ tenants</li>
  <li>the Infrastructure grant supports the cost of the infrastructure to charge at least 5 EVs and at least 1 chargepoint socket. This is a different grant from the one we are describing on this page. Find out about the Infrastructure grant. [link to Infrastructure guidance page]</li>
</ul>

      What do we mean by infrastructure?
    </span>
  </summary>
  <div class="govuk-details__text">
    <p class="govuk-body">Infrastructure means all the civil works, engineering, cabling, and connections from the power source to the parking bay, so you can install for a fully working chargepoint.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">If your customer already has the infrastructure and only needs to install chargepoints, they can apply for the Chargepoint grant for landlords.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Your customer can also apply for the Chargepoint grant for landlords if they have already had the infrastructure grant and now want to install more chargepoints.</p>

  </div>
</details>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-top-7" id="how-the-grant-works">Who can apply for this grant?</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">Customers may apply for this grant if they are one of the following:
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>landlord with a property that you let or intend to let</li>
  <li>right to manage (RTM) company</li>

</ul>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-top-7" id="customer">What kind of properties are eligible?</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">The property must be located in England, Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland. Properties in the Channel Islands and Isle of Man are not covered by this grant.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Customers can apply for:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

<p class="govuk-body">Customers cannot apply for this grant if they use the property for their own business.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-top-7" id="property">How much is the grant worth?</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">The grant covers up to 75% (including VAT) of the total cost of buying and installing EV chargepoint sockets.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">The grant cap is set at £350 (including VAT) per chargepoint socket. This means you can get up to £350 for each EV chargepoint socket you install. If you install a twin or double chargepoint socket you can get up to £700.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Landlords of residential properties can install up to 200 chargepoint sockets per financial year.</p>


<h2 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-top-7" id="process">What are my responsibilities as an installer?</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">Only OZEV authorised installers can claim the grant on behalf of the domestic customer. <a href="https://forms.dft.gov.uk/ozev-authorised-installer-application/">Apply to be an OZEV authorised installer. </a></p>

<p class="govuk-body">You must:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>tell your customer about their requirements for getting the grant</li>
  <li>only use <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/electric-vehicle-homecharge-scheme-approved-chargepoint-model-list">OZEV approved chargepoints</a - commercial and residential properties have different approved chargepoints</li>

  <li>notify the DNO of the installation in writing</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-margin-top-7">You are responsible for managing EV fire risk</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">Landlords, property owners and property managers are responsible for making sure that they check their car parks for potential EV fires.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">This means you must assess the parking area and put in place adequate and proportionate fire protection measures to guard against the risk to life from fire. You must also maintain these measures and update them as necessary when installing EV chargepoints. Your duties are covered in the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/1541/contents/made">Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005</a>.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-top-7" id="install_reqs">How does the grant process work?</h2>

  <li>The landlord will contact you about installing chargepoints.</li>
  <li>You survey the car park and produce a quotation that the landlord accepts.</li>
