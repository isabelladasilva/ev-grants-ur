    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      This statement was prepared on DD/MM/YYYY. It was last updated on DD/MM/YYYY.

    <p class="govuk-body">
      We used this approach to decide on a sample of pages to test. The service is measured against the Web Accessibility Initiative’s (WAI) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG 2.1) to give an accurate feedback on any non-compliant issues. To attain our standard accreditation all A and AA criteria must be achieved. To give a more accurate review of the service DAC employed 2 different testing processes:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>a manual technical audit using automated tools</li>
      <li>a dedicated team of user testers with differing disabilities using a range of adaptive technologies.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      The findings of both testing teams are combined to give an accurate feedback on the service.
