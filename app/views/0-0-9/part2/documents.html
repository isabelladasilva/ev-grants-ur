        Before installing the charge point, you need to show your installer proof that you are the nominated user of an employer vehicle.

    <p>This may be a letter from your employer proving that you are responsible for the vehicle.</p>

    <p>We will ask your installer to confirm that they have seen evidence of your ownership before they claim the Electric Vehicle Homecharge Scheme. <br><br>If they don't see this document, then they will be unable to install the chargepoint.</p>
