<h2 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-top-7" id="Overview">Overview</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">The government wants to help businesses and organisations who rent, lease or manage residential properties install EV chargepoints in their car parks.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">The EV infrastructure grant for residential car parks will give landlords and property managers money towards the infrastructure they need for chargepoints, as well as for installing the chargepoints themselves. They have to use an authorized OZEV installer to get the grant.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">The grant means they do not have to install all the chargepoints the infrastructure allows. They can plan for the future by creating infrastructure now that can enable chargepoints later on.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">There is a separate and different grant for installing EV chargepoints without infrastructure. This is the <a href="https://ev-grants.herokuapp.com/mmvp/installer/installer-step-by-step"><b>EV chargepoint grant for landlords</b></a>.</p>



<h2 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-top-7" id="What-grants-can-landlords-get?">What grants can landlords and property managers get for their car parks?</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">We have set up 2 grants to support residential landlords and property managers with the cost of installing EV chargepoints.

<p class="govuk-body"><b>The EV infrastructure grant for residential car parks</b> pays money towards the infrastructure your customer needs for chargepoints, as well as installing the chargepoints themselves.</p>

<p>To get this grant, the infrastructure must support at least 5 marked EV charging parking spaces. You must also install at least 1 chargepoint with 1 chargepoint socket</p>

<p class="govuk-body"><b>The EV chargepoint grant for landlords</b> pays money towards installing chargepoints only. This is a different grant from the one we are describing on this page. <a href="https://ev-grants.herokuapp.com/mmvp/installer/installer-step-by-step">Find out about the EV chargepoint grant for landlords</a>.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">If a landlord or property manager has already had the EV infrastructure grant for residential car parks and only needs to install chargepoints, they can apply for the EV chargepoint grant for landlords.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">They can also apply for the EV chargepoint grant for landlords if they have already had the infrastructure grant and now want to install further chargepoints.</p>


<h2 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-top-7" id="the-infrastructure-you-need-to-install">The infrastructure you need to install</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">The infrastructure needs to include:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>a new electrical connection at a metered electrical supply point, such as a consumer unit or feeder pillar</li>
<li>a dedicated, safe, unobstructed route for electrical cabling from the electrical supply point to the installed chargepoints and any future connection locations </li>
<li>arrangements for the safe installation of an electric vehicle chargepoint</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Infrastructure for future chargepoints</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">You must install cabling from a metered power supply to the future chargepoint locations so that someone can install a future chargepoint, at a future date, with the minimum amount of infrastructure work.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">You can do this by installing, for example, a:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>busbar system with connection locations for future chargepoints</li>
<li>concrete plinth or footing for a future chargepoint that will be connected to a metered electricity supply </li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">You must also make sure there is enough power for all the chargepoints and future connection locations. Making sure there is enough power may include:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>power upgrades to the local supply or network</li>
<li>applying load balancing solutions</li>
<li>upgrades to the buildingâ€™s electrical control room</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Future chargepoint location routes</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">As part of the infrastructure, you must make dedicated, safe, unobstructed routes from the electrical supply point to each identified future connection location.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">A future installer should be able to lay or insert any extra electrical cabling from the electrical supply to a chargepoint location, without the need for buildersâ€™ work. You can achieve this using any combination of electrical containment systems, such as electric cable:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>ducting including drawstrings</li>
<li>trunking or conduits</li>
<li>trays and cable ladders</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Earthing arrangements</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">The infrastructure must include all earthing arrangements any chargepoints need. You must also identify if future chargepoint locations need for any earthing arrangements.</p>




<h2 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-top-7" id="which-landlords-and-property-managers-can-apply?">Which landlords and property managers can apply?</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">This grant is forÂ businesses and organisations who rent, lease or manageÂ residentialÂ properties.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">They must have registered at Companies House or for VAT with HMRC. If they have not registered with either of these places, they will not be able to apply.</p>

 <p class="govuk-body">We will let private registered providers, charities and property factors who do not have a Companies House or VAT registration apply at a later date.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">They must be:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>landlords of residential property with property that they let or intend to let</li>
<li>right to manage (RTM) companies freeholders</li>
<li>residentsâ€™ management companies (RMCs)</li>
<li>companies owning the freehold</li>
<li>companies owning the buildingâ€™s common areas including shareholders who are the leaseholders</li>
<li>leaseholders who have the freeholderâ€™s consent to install a chargepoint</li>
<li>property factors (in Scotland)</li>
<li>private registered providers of social housing (PRP)</li>
<li>public authorities</li>
<li>housing associations</li>
<li>public landlords</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-top-7" id="what-kind-of-properties-can-get-this-grant?">What kind of properties are eligible?</h2>


<p class="govuk-body">The property must:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>be in England, Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland. Properties in the Channel Islands and Isle of Man can not get this grant</li>
<li>have an private off-street car park with at least 5 parking spaces, which is part of the property</li>
<li>be a multi-unit residential property such, as a block of flats, or an estate consisting of homes that share a common parking area.</li>
</ul>


<p class="govuk-body">If the property or car park is for mixed commercial and residential use, this grant will only pay towards parking spaces allocated to its residential units.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">The landlord or property manager must be able to show you that they have legal entitlement to the parking space if it is separate from the property. They may prove this showing you Land Registry title deeds.</p>



<h2 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-top-7" id="how-much-is-the-infrastructure-grant-worth?">How much is the EV infrastructure grant for residential car parks worth?</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">The EV infrastructure grant for residential car parks pays towards both the infrastructure and any chargepoints that you install at the same time as the infrastructure.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">How much for infrastructure?</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">Landlords and property managers can get up to Â£500 towards each EV charging socket the infrastructure will support, whether you install the sockets now or later.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">How much for chargepoints?</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">Your customer can get up to Â£350 towards the cost of buying and installing each chargepoint socket.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Grant caps</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">The final amount of grant funding available cannot be more than:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>75% of the cost of the installation you charge your customer</li>
<li>Â£30,000 </li>

</ul>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Example of how much the grant could be worth</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">To qualify for the grant, the minimum you would need to create is the infrastructure to support least 5 EV charging parking spaces and to install at least 1 chargepoint with 1 chargepoint socket.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">5 spaces supported by charging infrastructure = Â£2,500.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">1 chargepoint socket = Â£350</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Total = Â£2,850, as long as it is not more than 75% of the amount you charge your customer. In this case, Â£3,800.</p>



<h2 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-top-7" id="how-does-the-grant-process-work?">How does the grant process work?</h2>
<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">

<li>A landlord or property manager will contact you about installing chargepoints.</li>
<li>You must verify that the car park is eligible for the grant.</li>
<li>Your customer will then sign up for OZEV grants and make an application based on the quote for work that you both agree on.</li>
<li>If their application is successful, you then have 90 days to do the installation. You can extend this, for up to 1 year.</li>
<li>When you finish the installation, notify the relevant distribution network operator (DNO) and submit a BS7671 Electrical Installation Certificate.</li>
<li>Make a claim, adding proof that you have completed the job.</li>
<li>Your final invoice will include the total cost of the installation, including any VAT your charged, and the OZEV grant that reduces this total.</li>
<li>Once we have approved your claim, we will pay you the grant to you.</li>
