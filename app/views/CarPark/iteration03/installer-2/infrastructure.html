We want you to tell us how the infrastructure you created is ready for someone to install chargepoints in the future, with a minimum amount of infrastructure work.

<p class="govuk-body">If your infrastructure only supplies chargepoints you have already installed, leave this section blank.</p>


<p class="govuk-body">For example:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>you installed a busbar system with connection locations for each chargepoint. Each connection location is marked on your diagram</li>
  <li>you installed a footing for a future chargepoint that is connected to a metered electricity supply. Each footing location is marked on your diagram</li>
