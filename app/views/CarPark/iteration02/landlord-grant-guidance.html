<p class="govuk-body">The OZEV wants to help businesses and organisations who rent, lease or manage residential properties install EV chargepoints in their car parks.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">The residential EV car park grant will give you money towards the infrastructure as well as installing the chargepoints.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">You do not have to install all the chargepoints the infrastructure allows. You can plan for the future by creating infrastructure now that can charge EVs with chargepoints later on.</p>

<details class="govuk-details" data-module="govuk-details">
<summary class="govuk-details__summary">
<span class="govuk-details__summary-text">
What do we mean by infrastructure?
</span>
</summary>
<div class="govuk-details__text">
<p>Infrastructure for chargepoints means:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>cabling that runs from the power supply to the chargepoint location</li>
<li>electrical systems</li>
<li>signage</li>
<li>any onsite one-off software purchases, but not ongoing software support or services</li>
<li>grid connections</li>
<li>concrete plinths or footings for future chargepoints</li>
<li>vehicle barriers</li>
<li>upgrades to existing electrical infrastructure in the property</li>
<li>labour</li>
<li>project management</li>
</ul>
</div>
</details>



<p class="govuk-body">If you already have the infrastructure you need to install chargepoints, you can apply for the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://ev-grants.herokuapp.com/mmvp/landlord-grant-guidance">EV chargepoint grant for landlords (opens a new tab)</a></p>
<p class="govuk-body">You can also apply for the EV landlord chargepoint grant if you have already had the infrastructure grant and now want to install further chargepoints.</p>



<h2 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-top-7"" id="who-can-apply?">Who can apply?</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">You can apply for this grant if you are a:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>landlord with property that you let or intend to let</li>
<li>right to manage (RTM) company</li>
<li>residents' management company (RMC)
<li>company owning the freehold</li>
<li>company owning the buildingâ€™s common areas including shareholders who are the leaseholders</li>
<li>leaseholder who has the freeholderâ€™s consent to install a chargepoint</li>
<li>property factors (in Scotland)</li>
<li>private registered providers of social housing (PRP)</li>
<li>housing association</li>
<li>public authority</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">You must be a UK registered company and registered for VAT or at Companies House.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">If you are a registered company, charity or public sector organisation you can use your Companies House company registration number or VAT registration number to apply.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Your company registration number is the best number to use as it will speed up the application process.</p>


<h2 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-top-7" id="can-you-get-the-grant-with-your-property?">Can you get the grant with your property?</h2>


<p class="govuk-body">Your property must:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>be in England, Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland. Properties in the Channel Islands and Isle of Man cannot get this grant
<li>have a private off-street car park with at least 5 parking bays, which are part of the property</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">You cannot get a grant if you need to lay cables over public land such as pavements, even if this is a temporary arrangement.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">This grant does not cover holiday rental properties.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">You must have private off-street parking</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">The space where you are applying to install chargepoints must have a private parking space. You must own the parking space or have the sole legal right to it.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">The private parking may be connected to the property or separate from it.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">You must be able to show you have legal entitlement to the parking space if it is separate from the property. You may prove this by showing us proof of Land Registry title deeds.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">If you do not own the parking space or have the sole legal right to it, you cannot apply for the grant. This includes rented spaces.</p>




<h2 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-top-7"" id="how-much-is-the-car-park-grant-worth?">How much is the residential EV car park grant worth?</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">The residential EV car park grant pays towards both the infrastructure and any chargepoints that you install at the same time as the infrastructure.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-margin-top-7" id="how-the-grant-works">How much for infrastructure</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">You can get up to Â£500 towards each EV charging parking bay the infrastructure supports.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">How much for chargepoints</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">You can get up to Â£350 towards the cost of buying and installing each chargepoint socket.  Some chargepoints have 2 sockets. Each chargepoint socket can charge an EV.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">To get the full amount, the grant has to be less than 75% of the cost on the installation.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Example</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">To get the minimum residential EV car park grant you would need to create the infrastructure to enable 5 EVs parking bays and to install a chargepoint with at least 1 socket.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">5 x Â£500 + 1 x Â£350 = Â£2,850.</p>


<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Grant limitations</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">As a landlord or property manager, you can make 30 applications each financial year. The financial year runs from 6 April to 5 April the next year.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Each application can be for up to a maximum of Â£30,000 and only be for one address.</p>

<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
<li>You need create an account and make an application for the grant.</li>
<li>As soon as you have submitted it, we can tell you whether you are eligible for the grant.</li>
<li>If your application is successful, your installer will have 90 days to get the work done and to submit their part of the claim. </li>
<li>If you or your installer need more time, you can request an extra 90 days for up to 12 months from the date you first applied.</li>
<li>When your installer finishes the installation, they have to prove it is complete. This means that when your installer submits their part of the claim, they must send us proof that the work is done. This evidence includes a copy of your invoice and photos of the chargepoints they installed.</li>
<li>OZEV pays the grant to your OZEV authorised installer who passes the discount on to you. </li>
