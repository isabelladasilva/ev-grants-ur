<p class="govuk-body">We have set up 2 grants to support residential landlords and property managers with the cost of installing EV chargepoints.


<p class="govuk-body"><b>The EV infrastructure grant</b> pays money towards the infrastructure your customer needs for chargepoints, as well as installing the chargepoints themselves.</p>
<p>To get his grant, the infrastructure must enable at least 5 EV parking bays. You must also install 1 chargepoint.</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>cable routes, by which we mean channels for chargepoint cabling that run from the power supply to the chargepoint location</li>
<li>electrical containment systems</li>
<li>any associated reinstatement work</li>
<li>signage</li>
<li>earthing arrangements</li>

<p class="govuk-body">If your customer already has the infrastructure and only needs to install chargepoints, they can apply for the EV landlord chargepoint grant.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">They can also apply for the EV landlord chargepoint grant if they have already had the infrastructure grant and now want to install further chargepoints.</p>


<h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="which-landlords-can-apply-for-this-grant?">Which landlords and property managers can apply for EV infrastructure grant?</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">This grant is for businesses and organisations who rent, lease or manage residential properties. They must be: </p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>landlords of residential property with property that they let or intend to let</li>
<li>right to manage (RTM) companies freeholders</li>
<li>residents’ management companies (RMCs)</li>

<li>housing associations</li>
<li>public landlords</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="what-kind-of-properties-can-get-this-grant?">What kind of properties are eligible?</h2>


<p class="govuk-body">The property must:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>be in England, Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland. Properties in the Channel Islands and Isle of Man can not get this grant
<li>have an private off-street car park with at least 5 parking bays, which is part of the property</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">Landlords and property managers cannot get this grant if you need to lay cables over public land such as pavements, even if this is a temporary arrangement.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">This grant does not cover holiday rental properties.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="how-much-is-the-infrastructure-grant-worth?">How much is the EV infrastructure grant worth?</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">The infrastructure grant pays towards both the infrastructure and the chargepoints that you install at the same time as the infrastructure.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">How much for infrastructure?</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">Your customer can get up to £500 towards each parking bay the infrastructure supports charging at the same time.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">How much for chargepoints?</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">Your customer can get up to £350 towards the cost of buying and installing each chargepoint socket.  Each chargepoint socket can charge one EV.</p>


<h3 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-margin-top-4" id="how-the-grant-works">Example of how much the grant could be worth</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">To get the minimum infrastructure you would need to create the infrastructure to enable 5 charging EV parking bays, and to install 1 chargepoint socket.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">5 x £500 + 1 x £350 = £2,850.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Grant limitations</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">Landlords and property managers can make 30 applications each financial year. The financial year runs from 6 April to 5 April the next year.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Each application can be for up to a maximum of £30,000 and only be for one car park address.</p>

<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
<li>A landlord or property manager will contact you about installing chargepoints.</li>
