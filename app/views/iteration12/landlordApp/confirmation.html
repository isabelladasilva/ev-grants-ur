    <p class="govuk-body">We have sent you and Electric City Installers an email to confirm your application was submitted.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens now</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      The properties that you have detailed in this application are eligible for the grant.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      You can now contact your installer to arrange the installation of your chargepoints. Ensure your chargepoint model is approved by OZEV. If not, then you will not be eligible to receive the grant.
    </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Application validity period</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      This application is valid for 3 months. The grant amount will be secured and allocated until 6 February 2022. This means your installer has 3 months to complete the work and submit the claim.
    </p>

    <div class="govuk-inset-text">
      If, for any reason the work is not completed within this period, an extension of 90 days can be requested by you or the installer. This can be done from your account.
    </div>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens after the installation</h2>
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Installer will submit the claim</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      When the installation is completed your installer will have to submit the evidence of the installation. This includes photographs, chargepoint serial number for each chargepoint and the invoice provided to you as a customer.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
       The grant will be paid directly to your installer. The total grant amount must be passed on to you as a discount.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">

    </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">You can review and confirm installation was completed</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Once your installer submits the claim for this application, you will receive an email to review it.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      You will have 7 working days to approved or challenge it. If no action is taken, we will accept the claim and process the payment.
