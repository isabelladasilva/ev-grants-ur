      This eligibility period lasts for 3 months. You can tell OZEV before the end of that 3 months if you wish to extend your eligibility period. 
    </p>

    <p>Once your installer has installed and claimed for the chargepoints included in this claim, you will have 190 more chargepoints left to apply for this year.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      If the chargepoint models you have listed change to another eligible model before installation, that will not affect the validity of your eligibility. However, if any other information associated with your application changes during installation, then your eligibility for the scheme will be invalid.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      You can contact your installer to arrange the installation of your chargepoints.
