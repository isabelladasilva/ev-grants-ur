    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens now</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      The properties that you have detailed in this application are eligible for the grant.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      You can now contact your installer to arrange the installation of your chargepoints. Ensure your chargepoint model is approved by OZEV. If not, then you will not be eligible to receive the grant.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      This application is valid for 3 months. This means your installer has 3 months to complete the work. The grant amount will be secured and allocated until 10 November 2021.
    </p>

    <p>
      If, for any reason the work is not completed within this period, there is the possibility to request an extension for another month.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens after the installation</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      When the installation is completed the installer will submit the claim. The grant will be paid directly to your installer. The total grant amount must be passed on to you as a discount.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Your installer will have to submit the evidence of the installation. This includes photographs, chargepoint serial number for each chargepoint and the invoice provided to you as a customer.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Once your installer submits the claim for this application, you will receive an email to review it. You will have 7 working days to approved or challenge it.
